More spacing tweaks on radio/check, fix radio dot color, remove disabled from stories

More spacing tweaks on radiobuttons and checkboxes to make non-bounding-box variant align correctly.

Radiobutton dot color was set to Signature, just like in Figma. However, it turns out Figma was wrong.

Remove disabled variants from stories as we don't want to encourage using them.
