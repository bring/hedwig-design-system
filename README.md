# Hedwig Design System

Welcome to the Hedwig Design System ‚Äì a comprehensive design system built to streamline the development process across Posten and Bring's projects.

## ‚ú® Usage

Storybook: https://bring.github.io/hedwig-design-system/

This package has three packages

- `@postenbring/hedwig-tokens`
- `@postenbring/hedwig-css`
- `@postenbring/hedwig-react`

### Getting started

The simplest way is to just install the `@postenbring/hedwig-react` package, and start using the components. The css is imported in the javascript files so a bundler that supports side effect imports is required. Vite and Remix supports this out of the box.

```tsx
import { Box, PrimaryButton } from "@postenbring/hedwig-react";

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Box>
      <PrimaryButton>Hello, World</PrimaryButton>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

By default you will get the Posten theme in your app. If you want to use the Bring theme, you have to apply the `hds-theme-bring` class to the a wrapping element in e.g. your `index.html` or `App.tsx` file:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="hds-theme-bring">
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```
