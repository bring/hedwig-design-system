# Hedwig Design System

Welcome to the Hedwig Design System â€“ a comprehensive design system built to streamline the development process across Posten and Bring's projects.

## Usage

Storybook: https://bring.github.io/hedwig-design-system/

This package has three packages

- `@postenbring/tokens`
- `@postenbring/css`
- `@postenbring/react`

### Getting started

The simplest way is to just install the `@postenbring/hedwig-react` package, and start using the components. The css is imported in the javascript files so a bundler that supports side effect imports are required. Vite and Remix supports this out of the box.

```tsx
import {
  Box,
  PrimaryButton,
} from "@postenbring/hedwig-react";

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Box>
      <PrimaryButton>Hello, World</PrimaryButton>
    </Box>
  )
}
```
