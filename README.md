# Hedwig Design System

Welcome to the Hedwig Design System ‚Äì a comprehensive design system built to streamline the development process across Posten and Bring's projects.

## ‚ú® Usage

Storybook: https://bring.github.io/hedwig-design-system/

This package has three packages

- `@postenbring/hedwig-tokens`
- `@postenbring/hedwig-css`
- `@postenbring/hedwig-react`

### Getting started

The simplest way is to just install the `@postenbring/hedwig-react` package, and start using the components. The css is imported in the javascript files so a bundler that supports side effect imports is required. Vite and Remix supports this out of the box.

```tsx
import { Box, PrimaryButton } from "@postenbring/hedwig-react";

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Box>
      <PrimaryButton>Hello, World</PrimaryButton>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

By default you will get the Posten theme in your app. If you want to use the Bring theme, you have to apply the `hds-theme-bring` class to a wrapping element in e.g. your `index.html` or `App.tsx` file:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="hds-theme-bring">
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Custom css loading

The `@postenbring/hedwig-react` entrypoint automaticly imports `@postenbring/hedwig-css`, ensuring all the needed css is loaded.
For most projects and bundlers this just works.

If you need to handle css loading yourself you can you import the react packages from `@postenbring/hedwig-react/dist/index-no-css`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Contributing

We welcome anyone who would like to contribute to improving the Hedwig Design System. The core team is responsible for maintaining this repository. However, anyone seeking changes is encouraged to submit a pull request.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- pnpm (v8 or higher)

### Check node

Check if you have node 20 or higher

```bash
node -v
```

### Install node

If node is not installed, or you don't have version 20 or higher you need to install it. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), or use package manager like [`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), or [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf).

### Install pnpm

There are multiple ways to [install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), one is through npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the design system up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bring/hedwig-design-system.git
   cd hedwig-design-system
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) should now be available at [`localhost:6006`](http://localhost:6006). The [examples app](apps/examples/) should be available at [`localhost:6007`](http://localhost:6007).

## Publishing

### Releases

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to handle publishing of new package versions. The easiest way to publish a new version is to use the [changeset-bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot)'s comments on pull requests, which will help you create and commit a new changeset file. An example of a changeset:

```
---
"@postenbring/hedwig-css": patch
"@postenbring/hedwig-react": patch
---

:lipstick: Change font size on PrimaryButton component.
```

This changeset file will create patch releases of the `@postenbring/hedwig-css` and `@postenbring/hedwig-react` packages.

You can also use `pnpm changeset` in the project root folder, which will guide you through the creation of a changeset file.

### Snapshots releases

Snapshots of a branch is published when a new changeset file is present in a pull request. The snapshot release version is in the format `0.0.0-${branch}-${timestamp}`, e.g. `@postenbring/hedwig-react@0.0.0-refactor-button-iSIvTK2v-20231121205134`. This way, anyone who wants to contribute or request changes can create their own branch and automatically publish a snapshot version to the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40postenbring%2Fhedwig) for testing purposes. Snapshot versions can be found here:

- [hedwig-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@postenbring/hedwig-react?activeTab=versions)
- [hedwig-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@postenbring/hedwig-css?activeTab=versions)
- [hedwig-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@postenbring/hedwig-tokens?activeTab=versions)
