# Hedwig Design System

Welcome to the Hedwig Design System ‚Äì a comprehensive design system built to streamline the development process across Posten and Bring's projects.

## ‚ú® Usage

Storybook: https://bring.github.io/hedwig-design-system/

This package has three packages

- `@postenbring/hedwig-tokens`
- `@postenbring/hedwig-css`
- `@postenbring/hedwig-react`

### Getting started

The simplest way is to just install the `@postenbring/hedwig-react` package, and start using the components. The css is imported in the javascript files so a bundler that supports side effect imports is required. Vite and Remix supports this out of the box.

```tsx
import { Box, PrimaryButton } from "@postenbring/hedwig-react";

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Box>
      <PrimaryButton>Hello, World</PrimaryButton>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

By default you will get the Posten theme in your app. If you want to use the Bring theme, you have to apply the `hds-theme-bring` class to a wrapping element in e.g. your `index.html` or `App.tsx` file:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="hds-theme-bring">
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Contributing

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- pnpm (v8 or higher)

### Check node

Check if you have node 20 or higher

```bash
node -v
```

#### Install node

If node is not installed, or you don't have version 20 or higher you need to install it. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), or use package manager like [`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), or [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf).

### Install pnpm

There are multiple ways to [install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), one is through npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the design system up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bring/hedwig-design-system.git
   cd hedwig-design-system
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

## Publishing

### Releases

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to handle publishing of new package versions. The easiest way to publish a new version is to use the [changeset-bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot)'s comments on pull requests, which will help you create and commit a new changeset file. An example of a changeset:

```
---
"@postenbring/hedwig-css": patch
"@postenbring/hedwig-react": patch
---

:lipstick: Change font size on PrimaryButton component`.
```

This changeset file will create patch releases of the `@postenbring/hedwig-css` and `@postenbring/hedwig-react` packages.

You can also use `pnpm changeset` in the project root folder, which will guide you through the creation of a changeset file.

### Snapshots releases

Snapshots of a branch is published when a new changeset file is present in a pull request. The snapshot release version is in the format `0.0.0-${branch}-${timestamp}`, e.g. `@postenbring/hedwig-react@0.0.0-refactor-button-iSIvTK2v-20231121205134`. This way, anyone who wants to contribute or request changes can create their own branch and automatically publish a snapshot version to [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/) for testing purposes.
