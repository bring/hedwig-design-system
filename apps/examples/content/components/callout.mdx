A callout has a ruler to separate itself from other content. A heading and descriptive text follows below, with an action button at the bottom.

Callout can be used in articles and sidebars to either highlight or separate a section of content from the main content.

Callout can easily be misunderstood as a card-type of component as they share a few similarities, but the callout is more integrated with the page and content, while a card can be a standalone object.
